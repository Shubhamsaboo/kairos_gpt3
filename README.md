## 👾 Create & deploy GPT-3 powered apps
* This sandbox is an open-source 🔧to enable anyone turn their GPT-3 app ideas into reality with just a few lines of Python code
* It is built on top of Streamlit that enables you to quickly create & deploy web applications
* Streamlit takes care of hosting the endpoint and acts as a frontend interface for the web application

## 🎈 Try out our Sandbox Application
```bash
https://share.streamlit.io/shubhamsaboo/gpt3_sandbox/gpt_app.py
```

## 💥 Bringing up GPT-3 Sandbox Locally
🍴 Clone the `kairos_gpt3` repository using the following command

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shubhamsaboo/kairos_gpt3.git
```

You need to have python 3.7+ installed, and then you can create a python virtual environment using [pip](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/) or [conda](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#activating-an-environment) depending on your python setup. 

After installing and activating the virtual environment (The commands will differ for windows and linux installations which is clearly specified in the respective documentations), you can `cd` into the `email_generation` folder:

```bash
cd 'GPT-3 Sandbox'
cd email_generation
```

From `/email_generation` folder, you can run the following command to install the required dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

After installing the required dependencies, you can bring up the main application to validate that its working in your local enviroment. To bring up the application, you can run the following command from the `email_generation` folder.

```bash
streamlit run gpt_app.py
```


## 🎨 How to create an example application
* To create an app with a basic flow, you can use our default template for [Email Generation App](https://github.com/Shubhamsaboo/kairos_gpt3/tree/master/GPT-3_Sandbox/email_generation)
* This template has a flow that will work well for a couple of basic use-cases and you can use it just by replacing the default [training prompt](https://github.com/Shubhamsaboo/kairos_gpt3/blob/master/GPT-3_Sandbox/email_generation/training_data.py) with your application specifc prompt
* To test the application, provide a one-line task description in the -> **Input** text box
* You would then get an **Output** -> that should give you a good feeling of how to structure your application specifc tasks


## 🙌 Customize your application & contribute 
* If you want to play with the code and [contribute](https://github.com/Shubhamsaboo/kairos_gpt3/blob/master/CONTRIBUTE.md) your own application templates, please do! Sharing the knowledge with the GPT-3 community is the key mission of this sandbox ❤️
* To customize the UI of the web-applicaiton, please refer to the [Streamlit](https://docs.streamlit.io) 📖
