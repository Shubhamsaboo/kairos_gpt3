        ### 🎨 How to create an example application
        - To create an app with a basic flow, you can use our default template for [Email Generation App](https://github.com/Shubhamsaboo/kairos_gpt3/blob/master/GPT-3%20Sandbox/email_generation)
        - This template has a flow that will work well for a couple of basic use-cases and you can use it just by replacing the default [training prompt](https://github.com/Shubhamsaboo/kairos_gpt3/blob/master/GPT-3%20Sandbox/email_generation/training_data.py) with your application specific prompt
        - To test the application, provide a one-line task description in the -> **Input** text box
        - You would then get an **Output** -> that should give you a good feeling of how to structure your application specific tasks
        
        ### 🙌 Customize your application & contribute 
        - If you want to play with the code and [contribute](https://github.com/Shubhamsaboo/kairos_gpt3/blob/master/CONTRIBUTE.md) your application templates, please do! Sharing the knowledge with the GPT-3 community is the key mission of this sandbox ❤️
        - To customize the UI of the web-application, please refer to the [Streamlit](https://docs.streamlit.io) 📖
